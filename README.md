# Explanation of my Project

## Overview  
This project implements a **VPC with both public and private subnets** for a production-ready AWS architecture. It includes key AWS services such as **Bastion Host, NAT Gateway, Load Balancer, and Auto Scaling** to ensure secure and efficient cloud infrastructure.

## Architecture Diagram

## Components  
1. **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** – Defines the network for AWS resources.  
2. **Public Subnets** – Contains:
   - **Bastion Host** – Secure SSH access to private instances.
   - **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** – Distributes traffic to backend servers.
   - **NAT Gateway** – Allows private instances to access the internet securely.  
3. **Private Subnets** – Contains:
   - **Application Servers** – Running in an **Auto Scaling group** for scalability.
   - **Security Groups** – Restricts inbound and outbound traffic based on rules.
4. **S3 Gateway** – For accessing object storage securely.  

## How It Works  
- Users access the application through the **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**.  
- ALB routes traffic to backend **EC2 instances** running in **private subnets**.  
- The **NAT Gateway** enables private servers to download updates from the internet.  
- A **Bastion Host** in the **public subnet** provides SSH access to private servers.  

## Deployment Steps  
1. **Create the VPC** with public and private subnets.  
2. **Deploy the Bastion Host** in the public subnet.  
3. **Set up an ALB** for traffic distribution.  
4. **Configure Auto Scaling** for backend servers.  
5. **Attach NAT Gateway** for internet access in private subnets.  

## Security Best Practices  
1. Restrict SSH access using a **Bastion Host**.  
2. Use **Security Groups** to allow only necessary traffic.  
3. Enable **IAM roles** for secure access to AWS services.
